HEAD  -  Updated video.js to version 4.2.1.

         Added alternative viewing links underneath player in case
         video isn't playing properly.

         Added a responsive mode setting where videos are
         automatically resized with the browser window size (width
         and height fields are used to define the video
         proportions).

0.30  -  Backups now working. Previous version caused problems
         with site backups so please upgrade to this version
         if you're running an older version!

0.24  -  Renamed Github repository to follow the Moodle naming
         convention of "moodle-{type}_{name}", i.e.
         "moodle-mod_videofile".

0.23  -  Modified code and comments based on feedback from the Moodle
         Code Checker, which checks code against some aspects of the
         Moodle coding guidelines. Passes cleanly using the following
         settings (excludes third party video.js library):

             Path to check: mod/videofile
             Exclude: video-js
